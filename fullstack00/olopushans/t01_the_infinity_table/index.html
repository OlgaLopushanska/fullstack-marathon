        The Soul Stone ranks as possibly the most dangerous of all the Infinity Stones, with it holding a special
        standing among the others. Uniquely, in its shrine on Vormir, the Stone purposefully imposed a test
        to those who would try to claim it - only the sacrifice of a loved one to the Stone would allow for someone to wield it.

    <td>Housed in the Eye of Agamotto by Earth's first sorcerer Agamotto, a Master of the Mystic Arts can use the Time Stone (green) to alter and manipulate time. In Doctor Strange, Dr. Stephen Strange finds the Eye of Agamotto and learns how to use it to save the Earth from Dormammu by trapping him in a time loop until the demon abandons his plans for Earth.</td>

When allowed to influence an average human it will inevitably kill them, as evidenced by Jane Foster. The Reality Stone's power is such that it can affect reality on a universal scale.</td>

Due to the amount of energy the Power Stone releases, it is the most destructive out of all the Infinity Stones in terms of raw power.</td>
